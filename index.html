      <h3> About Raul </h3>
      <p> I graduated college with a degree in Finance and worked as an accounting analyst for a year before becoming a software developer.</p>
      <p> While I still enjoy crunching numbers I have found a new passion, and hope to incorporate web development with accounting to make things easier for people in the business world. </p>
